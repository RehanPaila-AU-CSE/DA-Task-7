Summary: Basic Sales Summary with SQLite and Python

- Created a small SQLite database file to store sales data.
- Learned how to connect Python to the SQLite database using the correct file path.
- Created a sales table and inserted sample sales data if the table was empty.
- Ran SQL queries inside Python to calculate total quantity sold and total revenue by product.
- Loaded the query results into a Pandas DataFrame for easy viewing and manipulation.
- Printed the sales summary in a readable table format.
- Created a simple bar chart to visualize revenue by product using matplotlib.
- Troubleshot common file path errors on Windows, including:
    • Using raw strings or proper path formats to avoid escape sequence issues.
    • Making sure database folders exist before connecting.
- Ensured smooth database file handling by automatically creating folders when needed.
